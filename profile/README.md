## What is WaterFlames?
The WaterFlames team is an open organization, created in August 2019 and part of the XyKong family of teams, focused on making lifestyle-friendly software. Since we changed our name on June 22, 2022, our pursuit of openness has grown stronger and stronger.

We have produced several open source projects based on the open source community. We put each project into the community, and each project is the result of a joint effort between Waterflame and the community.
## What are our guidelines?
### Basic guidelines

1. Openness: Waterflame belongs to the Internet, and the Internet is supposed to be open. We put in production with everyone on the Internet, not for profit, not for profit, and insist on using the power of openness to create one amazing work after another.
2. open source: insist on opening all the source code, documentation, design, everything is put into the community, create an excellent community.
3. Diversity: A diverse organization means more technical power, we accept all kinds of interesting ideas, not limited by language.
