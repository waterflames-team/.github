# WaterFlames
## What is WaterFlames?
The WaterFlames team is an open organization, created in August 2019.

We have produced several open source projects based on the open source community. We put each project into the community, and each project is the result of a joint effort between Waterflame and the community.

## What is our mission?
Technology is born from life, and technology is supposed to serve life. Our ultimate mission is to use technology to facilitate life and solve life's problems.

## What is our spirit?
Our core spirit is to move forward with an open mind, embrace the community and make progress.

## What if I want to talk to us face to face?
